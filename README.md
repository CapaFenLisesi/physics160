# Modeling the deformation of a golf ball
Final project for Physics 160 implemented with VPython

## Objective
Use a ball-spring model of a golf ball to simulate what happens when a golf ball is hit with a club

## Requirements to run
* Python 3.x
* [VPython](http://www.vpython.org)

## Results and more detailed information
See report/report.pdf for a very detailed report of how the simulation was created and results
